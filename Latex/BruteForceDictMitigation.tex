\begin{abstract}
The increasinng volume on digital systems in the modern society has increased the importance of security measures.
One of the most persistent threats to digital security is the brute-force and dictionary attack, which exploits weak passwords to be harmful to systems. 
This paper explores these attack techniques, their mechanisms, and their impact on the modern society. 
By understanding the key points behind brute-force and dictionary attacks, we can identify vulnerabilities in password systems and propose effective mitigation strategies. 
This topic was chosen due to its significant relevance in today's digital age, where establishing security standards and practices is essential for protecting sensitive information.
The study also emphasizes the need for stronger authentication methods and awareness to protect against evolving attack techniques. 
By combining theoretical analysis with practical demonstrations using tools such as Kali Linux, this work aims to highlight not only the risks posed by these attacks but also measures to improve digital security.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Sec:Sklicnapoglavje}
Password-based authentication remains one of the most common methods for system security, based on their simplicity and effiency. However, it continues to show significant vulnerabilities, facing brute-force and dictionary attacks. Those methods exploit the inherent weaknesses of user-created passwords, which are often short, predictable and based on common patterns. In spite of decades of research and development of numerous countermeasures, the human factor remains the weakest link in the security trifecta.

By the new advancements in computational power, these vulnerabilities got aggravated, making attackers more effient cracking passwords. A task that used to require days now takes seconds or even less. At the same time, passwords cracking techniques have become progressively sophisticated, including vast dictionaries, permutations, and adaptive algorithms. These developments highlight the critical need for powerfull mitigation strategies that not only address technical vulnerabilities but also focus on improving user practices 

This study investigates the mechanics of brute-force and dictionary attacks, demonstrates their effectiveness using practical experiments, and evaluates their strengths and weaknesses of most commonly used mitigation strategies. By analyzing passwords, by their entropy and characteristics, this work aims to emphasize the importance of adopting strategies to mitigate these attacks, by adopting stronger password policies and multi-factor authentication methods.

\subsection{Multi-factor Authentication}
Multi-factor authentication most known as "MFA" enhances security by requiring useres to provide more than one form of verification, usually 2 to 3 ways of verification, before accessing a system. By combining something the user knows, something they have, or something they are, MFA adds layers of protection that forbid unauthorized access. Research indicates that implementing MFA can block over 99.9\% of account compromising attacks, including brute-force and dictionary attempts.\cite{mfa_effectiveness} Within the frame of brute-force attacks, where attackers widely attempt various password combinations to gain unauthorized acess, MFA serves as a tough brake. Even if an attacker is sucessfull guessing a password, the aditional verification factors required by MFA, prevent unauthorized entries. This multi-layered system ensures that the compromise of a single factor does not grant access, thus significantly enhancing security.[11]\cite{mfa_brute_force} For that reason, adopting MFA is a crucial strategy to mitage risks associated with brute-force attacks, ensuring that only authorized userss can access sensitive systems and informations.

\subsection{Password lenght}
Password lenght is a critical factor to defend against brute-force attacks, where attackers can attempt multiple times all possible to estimate a password. The longer the passwords the longer it takes to be deciphered, increasing the number of potential combinations. Refering to a study analyzing real-world passwords found that shorter passwords are more receptive to brute-force attacks. with over 11\% of them being cracked. \cite{password_lenght} In addition , research indicates that a significant portion of compromised passwords are under 12 characters, suggesting that increasing password lenght can improve resistance to these attacks. \cite{specops} For that reason, enforcing longer password policies is an effective strategy to mitage the risk of digital break-ins. 

\subsection{SALT}
Salting is a securtiy method that consists in adding a unique, random value as a "salt" to each user's password before hashing. This procedure guarantees that even identical passwords result in distinct hash outputs, mitigating efficiently the risk of precomputed attacks such as rainbow tables. By embracing salts, attackers are compelled to compute the has for each password attempt individually, notably increasing the computational effort required for a successful attack. Research indicates that salting, when hashing, empowers password security by preventing attackers from leveraging precomputed hash databases. \cite{salting_description} Besides, studies have exhibiting that salting, when hashing, provides strong defense against dictionary and brute-force attacks. The addition of salt to passwords increases the complexity of the hashed output, making it more challenging for attackers to crack passwords using pre assembled tables and systems. \cite{salting_algo} For that reason, salting techniques are fundamental practices in enhancing password security and protecting against unauthorized access.
